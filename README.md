RL + LSTM Hybrid Trading Agent  
A research and deployment project for a reinforcement learning-based trading bot using Deep RL, LSTM predictive models, and market simulation.

## Structure

- `agent/` â€“ RL and meta-RL agent code
- `environment/` â€“ Trading environment & rewards
- `models/` â€“ Forecasting models (e.g., LSTM)
- `data/` â€“ Market data (historical + live)
- `notebooks/` â€“ Prototyping & research notebooks
- `deployment/` â€“ Scripts for running/deploying
- `utils/` â€“ Tools, configs, helpers
- `virtualization/` â€“ Docker/env setup

## Phase Goals
- Phase 1: Setup + Data Ingestion âœ…
- Phase 2: Trading Environment + Reward Engineering ðŸ”œ
- Phase 3: Train Hybrid Agent (RL + LSTM)
